# What I attempted to Accomplish

I have been the biggest comic book fan since my wife first introduced them to me about 10 years ago. I love the ability to find great stories, exciting characters and deep dive into the timelines. The challenging thing about comic books is that they often share titles, characters, and are often repeated / rebooted in different years. My main goal is to improve the ability to find these comics and simulate an improved website that sells them.

The biggest comic book seller in America comes from my hometown Denver, Co and their website is aweful to navigate and hard to identify the right comic books. [Mile High Comics](https://www.milehighcomics.com)

Using the Algolia I was able to use InstantSearch, Hits, Refinement Lists, Range Sliders, Pagination, SortBy to make it easier to find comics. Within the Hits I am able to use react to create a comic book card that displays:
1. Title
2. Issue Number
3. Release Data
4. Creator
5. Description
6. Price
7. Comic Book Cover Image

Relevance:

On the side of the page I am using a few things to help filter for the right comic books. A Refinement List for both characters in the comics, and creators of the comics. As I explained earlier some of the most difficult things is that comic books repeat, reboot, and often copy issues with different characters, storylines and so fourth - making it difficult to identify the right series.

The Sorby also allows for easier access of A-Z, Z-A, and Prices (Asc & Desc)

Improvements:
I think its important to let users know what tech stack they are looking at, I realized not until after that it defaults to javascript, and that I could change to react for better documentation.

Improvement of API vs Dashboard capabilities would be great! I think I found myself trying to understand if it was possible to complete certain things within a dashboard vs API and vice versa.
